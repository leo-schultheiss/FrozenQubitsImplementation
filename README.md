# Implementation for the measurement of the effectiveness of FrozenQubits on sparse graphs
We used the original sourcecode of FrozenQubits provided in their paper.
The evaluation was made with Evaluation.py to test the method on sparse graphs such as 2-regular graphs and randomly generated graphs as implemented in Random_sparse_graph_generator.py
